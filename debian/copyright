License: link exception
 As a special exception to the GNU Lesser General Public License, you
 may link, statically or dynamically, a "work that uses the Library"
 with a publicly distributed version of the Library to produce an
 executable file containing portions of the Library, and distribute that
 executable file under terms of your choice, without any of the additional
 requirements listed in clause 6 of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
 By "a publicly distributed version of the Library", we mean either the
 unmodified Library as distributed by the authors, or a modified version
 of the Library that is distributed under the conditions defined in clause
 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License.  This exception does not
 however invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be
 covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License.
